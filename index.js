// Exercise 1: Age Checker
// Ask the user to enter their age. If they are 18 or older, display "You are an adult." Otherwise, display "You are not an adult."
let age = prompt("How are you?")

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("Your are an adult")
}else if (age < 18) {
  console.log("Your are not an adult")
}




// Exercise 2: Simple Comparison
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and displays whether the first number is greater, less than, or equal to the second number.
// Note: make sure you have the correct types!
let one = prompt("Enter number 1")
let two = prompt("Enter number 2")

if (one > two) {
  console.log("Number 1 is bigger")
}else if (one < two) {
  console.log("Number 2 is bigger")
}else (one >= two) 
  console.log("Your numbers are equal")



// Exercise 3: Even or Odd
// Create a program that asks the user for an integer and then prints whether the number is even or odd. (Google how to check this!)
let int = prompt("Enter an integer")

if (int % 2 == 0) {
  console.log(int + " is even.");
} else {
  console.log(int + " is odd.");
}


// Exercise 4: Day of the Week
// Prompt the user to enter a day of the week (e.g., "Monday"). Display a message that says whether it's a weekday or the weekend.
let day = prompt("Pick a day of the week")

let week = [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,]
let weekend = [Sunday, Saturday]



// Exercise 5: Age Group Classifier
// Prompt the user to enter their age and categorize them into different age groups:
// - 0-12: Child
// - 13-19: Teenager
// - 20-64: Adult
// - 65+: Senior Citizen





// Exercise 6: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
